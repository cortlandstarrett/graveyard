x- 01  min  CDS   5.1   I think the build scripts could live 
in a public repository.  I know that some day they will.  For now 
they can live in the private repo.  But it is not a 
requirement that they live in a private repo.

Suggestion: Just strike "The build scripts" from this.  

x- 02  min   CDS  7.1.3    The updates between the "switch flipping" 
should be a commit to the github master.  It will be good to see 
those initial difference between day 0 and "switch flip".  

x- 03  min   CDS 7.3   It seems that this should be done before we start.  
x- 04  min  5 Bob      All things needed by the build shall be stored in RCS  
x- 05  min  5 SKB      We shall still be able to build from our CVS read-only repo.
                       This is needed for maintaince releases.  
x- 06  min  7.5 Bob    We currently do not put eclipse in RCS.  Put it in SVN and do an update.  
                       Once this is done everthing needed by the build is in RCS.  
x- 07  min  7.4.1      State this, don't make it a suggestion.  
x- 08  min  8.3  Bob   Build the last BP release from CVS to assure we still can.  

   
No major observations, a re-review is not required.
