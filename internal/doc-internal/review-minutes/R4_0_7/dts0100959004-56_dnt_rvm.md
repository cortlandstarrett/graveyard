_- 02  min  KB    5        Create the new issue for the UI inconsistencies that are not handled with this work. Call out in the analysis that this will be handled separately.  See if this

_- 03  min  KB    5        Add numbering to all paragraphs or none.  It is currently odd that only the middle paragraph is numbered.
