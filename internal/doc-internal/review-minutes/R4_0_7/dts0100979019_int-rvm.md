-- Num Type  Who  Section  Comment
x- 01  min   bob  3      Note that this is caused by a corrupted model, and we have no way of knowing how it happened.
x- 02  min   all  4.1    When encountering a corrupted connector do not throw an exception, instead log an 
                         exception, and correct the problem.
x- 03  min   all  5.1  By leaving th element in place, every time the reconciler runs over it, it will 
                       report an error.
                       We have decide it is best to go ahead and removed this corrupted element and force a
                       new, good one, to be recreated.
	 
      	               Force the reconciler to rerun after deleting it so it 
      	               recreates the  graphical element.
x- 04  min   skb  5.1  Record the message that is being logged.
                      -Don't use the word "corrupted" in the message.  
                      Also, have it report that BridgePoint is fixing the problem.
x- 05  min   bob  7  Add a check to assure the invalid element is removed and the message 
                     is not reported the next time reconciler runs.
