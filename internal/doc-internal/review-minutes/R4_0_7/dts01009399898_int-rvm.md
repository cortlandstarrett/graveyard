x- 03  min   Travis 8      Add to schema on MC-Java.
x- 04  min   Cort   8      Add field to MC schema.
x- 05  min   Keith  review Investigate why isRealized is used in component and
                           not in External Entity.
		     Travis: In the component case the isRealized attribute was added
		             before support for a path was added.  There is no special
		             reason for the addition other than that.  Therefore for
		             this issue we will not add the same attribute to the EE
		             case.

No major observations, a re-review is not required.
