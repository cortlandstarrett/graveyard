x- 01  min   bob  6.2      How will we control inclusion of this feature?

                           It is done by including the changes in 6.2 (or not including them).
                           There will be a seperate branch created that contains this change.  It will not be
                           promoted right now because we are leaving this disabled.  When we want to enable it
						   we will incldue this branch.
						   Branch name will be: dts0100938460-Turn-On-Feature
						   Note: If unit tests are added they should be in dts0100938460-Turn-On-Feature

 			   branch = AssemblyConnectorEnablement
