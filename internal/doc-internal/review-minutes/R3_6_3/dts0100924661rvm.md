-- Num Type  Who  Section  Comment
_- 01  min   bob  6.1/6.2/6.3      Explicitly point to the appropriate sequence 
                                   diagram in
                                   each of these sections to help the reader. 
_- 02  min   CDS  6.4      "synchronous messages" -> 
                            "parallel synchronous messages"  
                            
_- 03  min   title  CDS      "parallel synchronous messages are not allowed"
                                 is the crux of this.  Change the 
                                 title of the SR and he note to reflect this.

_- 04  min   doc  CDS      Is a synchronous message with a void the same as a 
                           signal?
                           
                           The answer is no.  This should be described in 
                           documentation.
                           
_- 05  min   doc  CDS      Are parallel sync messages a bad thing in general.
                           Should xtUML ever handle this?
                           
                           Raise an issue to investigate the execution engine
                           to see if we can make this work.  This is a huge 
                           amount of work
                           and we will, right now say we do not support this.
                           
_- 06  min   6  bob      Can we identify the parallel sync message attempt
                           and prevent it by issuing an error?
                           
                           Campbell says this would be very hard and 
                           Java does not do anything like this...
                           There would also be a runtime cost.
                           
                           However, this would satisfy the requirement
                           called out by this issue.  
                           
                           Investigate this.  Perhaps this can be a separate
                           issue if it is too much would now.
                           
                           After discussion, Raise an issue for:
                           		1) Second enqued message
                           		2) Deadlock
                           	
_- 07  min   general  CM   Who will give this info to the customer?

						   Robert will give this information to the 
						   customer. 
						   
_- 08  min   general  bob   migrate the analysis note, design note and model
                           to a public git repo.  
                           Do not use the editor repository (this is not the
                           editor). 
   
No major observations, a re-review is not required.
