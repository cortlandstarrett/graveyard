# Port MC-Java to internal BridgePoint parser - Phase 1 Pre-builder.
### xtUML Project Design Note

1. Abstract
-----------
The xtUML Editor in BridgePoint is going open source.  We need to split the source code so that Verifier and perhaps other parts can remain closed source. This note covers the promotion of build infrastructure needed so that the BridgePoint Pre-builder can be used with MC-Java. 

2. Document References
----------------------

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
An unexpected test failure was noted the io.mdl suite. This was traced to
threading differences on different workstations. The threading differences
were not relevant to the tests and were associated with editors being left
open from a previous test. Accordingly, IOMdlTestGenerics.java was modified
so that its setup method closes all editor windows and performs a read and
dispatch loop prior to commencing the test. This caused a cascade test
failure in testODMSImport. The expected results for this test were updated
and the test should now pass repeatably on other workstations.

A late test failure was noted in the Canvas CCP tests. This exposed some
incorrect expected result data. An issue [4] is raised to track fixing
that data correctly.

7. Unit Test
------------
All J-Units must pass
