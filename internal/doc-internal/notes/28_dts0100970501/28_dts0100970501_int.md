3. Background
-------------
During merge testing it was noted that automated merges could leave a model in
a state where its integrity is questionable.  An example of such a situation is
where a merge adds a new attribute which shares the same name as another in the
same class. 

4. Requirements
---------------
4.1 Create a tool that can be run on demand which reports any model integrity  
    issues that are found in [3] and [4].

5. Work Required
----------------
5.1. Integrity checks

5.1.1 New model elements

To capture integrity issues a new class is added to the ooaofooa,
Integrity Issue.   This class has attributes to capture the following data for
an issue:

Description
Severity
ElementName
ElementPath
ElementID

To capture an issue's severity a new Enumeration is created, Severity.  It has
three enumerators, Error, Warning and Information.

The ElementName, ElementPath and ElementID are used to display information in
reports such that a user will be able to locate and address the issue.

Another class is added, Integrity Manager.  This class is the owner of all
issues found during an integrity check.  The Integrity Manager has an
association with System Model which allows new operations within the ooaofooa to
associate created issues with the Integrity Manager.  Disposal and the tearing
down of associations is currently handled by the initiator of the integrity
check.  In the future we may add support in the problems view in which case the
disposal approach will likely need to change.

Both of these classes are added under a new subsystem, Model Integrity.

5.1.2 checkIntegrity operations

Each class that requires integrity checking has a new operation added,
checkIntegrity().  All of these operations do the following:

- Determine if there is an issue
- Locate the system they are under and the Integrity Manager instance
- Create an instance of Integrity Issue setting the required attributes to
  describe the issue
- Relate the issue to the manager

The following list gives the created operations and when an issue is determined.
<pre>
Association.checkIntegrity() - When a sibling association shares the same number  
Interface Operation.checkIntegrity() - When a sibling operation shares the same  
                                       signature  
Interface Signal.checkIntegrity() - When a sibling signal shares the same  
                                    signature  
Port.checkIntegrity() - When a sibling port shares the same name  
Property Parameter.checkIntegrity() - When a sibling parameter shares the same  
                                      name   
Constant Specification.checkIntegrity() - When a sibling specification shares  
                                          the same name  
Symbolic Constant.checkIntegrity() - When a sibling constant shares the same  
                                     name  
Bridge.checkIntegrity() - When a sibling bridge shares the same signature  
Bridge Parameter.checkIntegrity() - When a sibling parameter shares the same  
                                    name  
(Enumeration Data Type, User Data Type, Structured Data Type).checkIntegrity() -  
							        When a sibling data type shares the same  
							        name  
Enumerator.checkIntegrity() - When a sibling enumerator shares the same name  
Function.checkIntegrity() - When a sibling function shares the same signature  
Function Parameter.checkIntegrity() - When a sibling parameter shares the same  
                                      name  
Structure Member.checkIntegrity() - When a sibling member shares the same name  
State Machine Event.checkIntegrity() - When a sibling event shares the same  
                                       signature or number  
State Machine Event Data Item.checkIntegrity() - When a sibling parameter shares  
                                                 the same name  
State Machine State.checkIntegrity() - When a sibling state shares the same name  
                                       or number  
Transition.checkIntegrity() - When two transitions leaving the same state share  
                              event assignment  
Attribute.checkIntegrity() - When a sibling attribute shares the same name  
Model Class.checkIntegrity() - When a sibling class shares the same key letters  
                               or number  
Operation.checkIntegrity() - When a sibling operation shares the same signature  
Operation Parameter.checkIntegrity() - When a sibling parameter shares the same  
                                       name  
</pre>
Those elements that compare signatures each have an operation added,
getSignature().  Each of these methods are implemented in the same way in that
they build a string representation of the signature.  That representation is as
follows:

action_name(param_one.type, param_two.type)

The NonRootModelElement class has an empty method added, Checkintegrity().  This
allows for anonymous calling in reporting tools.

5.1.3 Dangling reference detection [5]

The NonRootModelElement class is extended to add a checkReferentialIntegrity()
method.  This method uses a new utility class that is generated by a new
archetype, generate_rto_util.arc.  This archetype generates a utility class that
will find all referred to objects for a given element.  The
checkReferentialIntegrity() makes use of this and for each referred to object
checks that any are still proxies.  If they are this means that the real element
could not be loaded and that an issue should be created for the dangling
reference.  The created issue is associated with the Integrity Manager that is
associated with the NonRootModelElement's System Model.

5.2. Integrity checking

5.2.1 IntegrityChecker

A new utitily class is added to bp.core.  This class, IntegrityChecker, has two
public methods.  The first method is runIntegrityCheck, which will call
Checkintegrity() on the given NonRootModelElement.  It will then proceed to
traverse the parent child tree calling Checkintegrity() on all children.  The
list of all issues created is returned.  The second method is
createReportForIssues().  This method will generate a String that is a report of
all given issues.  The generated report looks like this:

ERROR: Found another parameter under the same operation with a matching name.

Element Name: param  
Element Path: ModelIntegrityTests::Operation Parameter Tests::Class::Operation::param

and this for dangling references:

ERROR: Found a dangling reference.  An element with the following attributes could not be found:

Referenced Element ID: 4c3a3a47-15bc-4b4b-b8bb-fcf5f36f3ef2
Referenced Element file: /ModelIntegrityTests/models/ModelIntegrityTests/Dangling Reference Tests/Package One/Component/Component.xtuml

Element Name: Component
Element Path: ModelIntegrityTests::Dangling Reference Tests::Package Two::ModelIntegrityTests::Dangling Reference Tests::Package One::Component

5.2.2 Utility action

A new action is created in bp.utilities, CheckModelIntegrity.  This action runs
an integrity check for all selected NonRootModelElements.  If any issues are
found a text dialog is shown with the report.  The dialog shown supports
scrolling to accommodate long reports.  The scrolling text dialog supports
standard text functions like copy.  This action is called from a new menu item
under the BridgePoint Utilities pop up menu.  

5.3. CLI merge

After a completed CLI merge, a call to the IntegrityChecker class is made to
create an integrity report.  This report is then printed to the console.

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1 GraphicalCommandStack

A bug was found during creation of the test model for this issue.  There is a
case where a GEF command was coming through to our command stack manager that
should be simply executed rather than being executed inside of a graphically
created transaction.  This command is for drag and drop copying of an element
when holding the ctrl key.  We already ignore it in most cases, but those cases
had the command come in as a compound command.  A compound command holds many
commands in one.  The GraphicalCommandStack class is modified to ignore the case
where the clone command comes through outside of a compound command.

6.2 Expected output for integrity checks

A customer can grep for integrity check output using the following:

No issues found. (used to determine if there are no issues)
ERROR: (used when there were integrity errors found)
WARNING: (used when an integrity warning was found)
INFO: (used when an integrity issue is informational)

7. Unit Test

being tested.  All new code described in 5.1.2 is covered by the generic
