# The 'Allow operations inside where clauses of select statements' preference is ignored when in a plug-in customization file
### xtUML Project Implementation Note


1. Abstract
-----------
This note describes the fix for an issue with the preferences initialization 
file as well as additional code cleanup in preference handling while addressing
the original problem.

2. Document References
----------------------
[1] Issues 63, https://github.com/xtuml/internal/issues/63  
[2] CQ DEI dts0100942776 - The 'Allow operations inside where clauses of select statements' preference is 
ignored when in a plug-in customization file  
[3] CQ DEI dts0100696825 - Restore Defaults do not work properly for all Preference  
[4] CQ DEI dts0100897201 - Preferences dialog is not always updated via "OK"  
[5] CQ DEI dts0100732333 - BridgePoint Preference changes do not persist if the preference page is changed before saving  

3. Background
-------------
BridgePoint has a number of preferences that are given default values in the
```com.mentor.nucleus.bp.pkg/plugin_customization.ini``` file.  A customer 
discovered that when they tried to set the preference that controls "Allow
operations inside where clauses of select statements", the setting did not
actually take effect.  

A number of issues ([2], [3], [4], [5]) with the preference handling have been 
created by engineering and by customers in the past.  These issues are addressed
with the code cleanup done for this issue.  

4. Requirements
---------------
4.1  Preferences set in the INI file shall be used when BridgePoint is started.  
4.2  The "Restore Defaults" button shall reset the BridgePoint/xtUML preferences
  to their default values.  
4.3  User-selected preference changes shall be applied to the stored values when
  the preference dialog is dismissed with OK.  
  
5. Work Required
----------------
5.1. Improve consistency of preference names and defaults  
5.1.1  Update the ```bp.pkg/plugin_customization.ini``` file to have default
  values for every BridgePoint preference.  This gives the users visibility to 
  what settings are available and makes sure we have meaningful defaults for
  every setting.  
5.1.2  Update ```BridgePointPreferenceStore.java``` to use consistent 
  capitalization for all preference names.  
5.1.3  Update ```BridgePointPreferenceStore::restoreModelDefaults()``` to set 
  the passed-in model preferences to the same default values we provide in the
  INI file.  Previously, the values for some settings were not consistent
  between this function and the INI file.  
  
5.2  Update ```BridgePointPreferenceStore.java``` to stop calling ```store.setDefault()```
  in the ```loadModel()``` function.  Setting the default value here over-rides 
  the default set in the INI file.  The code is changed to remove these calls 
  and just use the INI settings.    
  
5.3. Preference Page Clean-up    
5.3.1  The preference pages are at ```com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core\src\com\mentor\nucleus\bp\core\ui\preferences\*Preferences.java```
  and ```com.mentor.nucleus.bp.ui.graphics\src\com\mentor\nucleus\bp\ui\graphics\preferences\GraphicalEditorPreferences.java```  
5.3.2  Make sure each page has a ```performDefaults()``` function that resets
  the local copy of the BridgePoint preferences to the default values, then 
  updates the current page's UI with the new settings.     
5.3.3  Refactor code in the preference page classes to break out preference 
  setting to a single routine that is callable from multiple places inside the
  class.  
5.3.4  The author discovered that when closing the preferences dialog inside
  BridgePoint, the ```performOk()``` for each page the user viewed is called. 
  Each of these ```performOk()'s``` may cause the store to be updated.  So, our
  code is changed to make sure the local copy of the preferences model is up to 
  date before we modify and save it.  

6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1  While cleaning bp.model.test, the project was marked dirty.  This was traced
  back to a missing hand-craft file in the "ignore" list in ```bp.model.compare.test/src/com.mentor.nucleus.bp.model.compare.test/generate.xml```   
6.2  The Junits uncovered a problem in mismatched expected/actual results in the
  IOMDL Tests 2.  This was solved by manually setting a preference to the proper
  value in the test case in ```bp.io.mdl.test/src/com.mentor.nucleus.bp.io.mdl.test/src/com/mentor/nucleus/bp/io/mdl/test/OALPersistenceTestsGenerics.java```

7. Unit Test
------------
7.1  Test preference change in INI  
  - Start BridgePoint
  - Open ```bp.pkg/plugin_customization.ini```
  - Open ```Window > Preferences > xtUML```, check the value of each preference 
  on this page and on the rest of the preference pages
  - __R__ Verify the value specified in the INI file matches what is displayed
  on the preference page UI
  - Close BridgePoint
  - Edit ```bp.pkg/plugin_customization.ini```, change every one of the BridgePoint
  preference values.  Save the file.
  - Start BridgePoint
  - Open ```bp.pkg/plugin_customization.ini```
  - Open ```Window > Preferences > xtUML```, check the value of each preference 
  on this page and on the rest of the preference pages
  - __R__ Verify the value specified in the INI file matches what is displayed
  on the preference page UI
  - Close BridgePoint
  - Edit ```bp.pkg/plugin_customization.ini```, change every one of the BridgePoint
  preference values back to their original.  Save the file. (If running in a 
  debug environment just replace the current file with HEAD revision) 
  
7.2  Test the functionality of the Restore Defaults button
  - Start BridgePoint
  - Open ```Window > Preferences > xtUML > Action Language```
  - Note the state of all the settings (Should be Yes, Yes, unchecked, unchecked)
  - Change all the settings to the opposite of the current settings (i.e. set to No, No, checked, checked) 
  - Press Restore Defaults 
  - __R__ Each settings is changed back to its original value (Yes, Yes, unchecked, unchecked)
  - Open ```xtUML > Message Direction``` page 
  - Change the setting to the opposite value
  - Press Restore Defaults 
  - __R__ The setting changes back to the original
  - Open ```xtUML > Model Export``` page
  - Change "Export OAL" to Yes and "Export Graphics" to No
  - Press Restore Defaults 
  - __R__ The settings are changed back to the original values
  - Open ```xtUML``` page 
  - Change each setting to the opposite value
  - Press Restore Defaults 
  - __R__ The settings change back to the original

  - Press Restore Defaults 
  - __R__ The setting changes back to the original

  - Change the setting to the opposite value
  - Press Restore Defaults 
  - __R__ The setting changes back to the original
  - Open ```xtUML > xtUML Translate``` page 
  - Change the setting to the opposite value
  - Press Restore Defaults 
  - __R__ The setting changes back to the original

7.3  Check that the changes are saved when OK'd from a different page  
  - Start BridgePoint
  - Open ```Window > Preferences > xtUML```
  - Change Parse all activities value 
  - Open ```Window > Preferences > xtUML > Action Language```
  - Select Apply 
  - Select OK 
  - Open ```Window > Preferences > xtUML```
  - __R__ Parse all activities value is set to your last selection 
  
7.4  Test that preference changes are persisted
  - Start BridgePoint
  - Open ```Window > Preferences > xtUML``` page 
  - Change each setting to the opposite value
  - Press OK 
  - Open ```Window > Preferences > xtUML``` page
  - __R__ The settings are still the changed values
  - Press Restore Defaults 
  - __R__ The settings change back to the original
  - Open ```Window > Preferences > xtUML > Action Language```
  - Change each setting to the opposite value
  - Press OK

  - Press OK
  - Open ```xtUML > Model Export``` page
  - __R__ The settings are still the changed values
  - Press Restore Defaults 
  - __R__ The settings are changed back to the original values
  - Open ```xtUML > xtUML Execute``` page 
  - Change each setting
  - Press OK
  - Open ```xtUML > xtUML Execute``` page
  - __R__ The settings are still the changed values
  - Press Restore Defaults 
  - __R__ The settings change back to the original values
  - Open ```xtUML > xtUML Translate``` page 
  - Change the setting to the opposite value
  - Press OK
