x- 01  min   bob  3        Add a description of [2]  
x- 02  min   xxx  6.4      ResetClassLoaer takes an argument.  It is redundant.
                           With the change made in 6.2 we do not need this
                           argument, so remove this redundant parameter.
x- 03  min   CMC  general  Look at this note on the web.  It's markdown is
                           not pretty.  
x- 04  min   CMC  9.2      This is not automated.  Call out that this is 
                           manual and add a new issue for it to SMA QA.

                           Note in the test issue that once [2] is resolved
                           the test will not be needed anymore.
   
No major observations, a re-review is not required.
