Possible safe unary operations:

unary operation
not_empty variable

nested unary operation
not empty variable

unary operation in a pex
(not_empty variable)

unary operation in a nested pex
((not_empty variable))

unary operation in a binary operation in a pex
(not_empty variable AND x = 1)

unary operation in a binary operation left side
not_empty variable AND x = 1

unary operation in a binary operation right side
x = 1 AND not_empty variable

unary operation in a binary operation in a pex
(not_empty variable) AND (x = 1)

unary operation in a nested binary operation
x = 1 AND (not_empty variable AND y = 2) 

unary operation in an elif
elif(not_empty variable)

empty variable test
(empty variable)
else <- safe

unary operation in a while statement
while(not_empty variable)

Dangerous tests

if(x = 1)
elif(not_empty some_variable)
else
for each test in tests
while(x > 2)

Tests for chain conditionality function

Conditional selects without testing chain

Any select from instances of
Any select from instances of where
Any select related by where
