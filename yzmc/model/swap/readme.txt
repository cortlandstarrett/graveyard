This model shows an extremely simple Size, Weight and Power system.

Starting from nothing, the simplest ever component diagram is built
using xtUML. Two components and an interface are added to a package.
Then, the two components are wired together in a simple deployment
configuration. Every step is shown. This is a pattern that is used
in almost all component models. Message sending in shown in the sequel.

This video follows from HOWTO Create a Component Diagram from Scratch.
It shows how to send messages between components using action language (OAL)
in the ports.  The simulation engine (Verifier) is then run to send the
messages starting with an init message followed by stimulus and response.
